- Complete transcripts of monetary policy deliberations
- Official interest rate announcements and accompanying statements
- Speeches by governors, deputy governors, and board members
- Press conference transcripts and introductory statements
- Detailed accounts of policy meetings and decision-making processes

These documents provide critical insights for research in monetary economics, financial markets, communication strategy, text mining, and policy analysis. Each text includes the original publication URL for verification and further context.
